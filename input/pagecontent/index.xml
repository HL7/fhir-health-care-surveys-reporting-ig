  <h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
    The Making EHR Data More Available for Research and Public Health (MedMorph) project seeks to advance public health and patient-centered outcomes by using emerging health data and exchange standards, such as Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and Clinical Quality Language (CQL), to develop and implement an interoperable solution that will enable access to clinical data. The MedMorph project fits within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) strategic imperative of transforming how data are collected, used, and shared through modern Information Technology (IT) capabilities to save lives and improve health. The MedMorph project is funded by the Health and Human Services (HHS) Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) and executed by the Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Laboratory Services (CSELS) Public Health Informatics Office (PHIO) to advance research and public health goals.

    <p>   
The project aims to leverage the maturation of standards and requirements for certification of health information technology by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC) that underpin many EHRs. Standards and regulations such as FHIR, the ONC 2015 Edition Common Clinical Data Set (CCDS), 2015 Edition Cures Update - United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) Version 1, February 2020 and standardized application programming interfaces (API) for patient services have created a health IT environment that is ripe for developing standards-based scalable and extensible solutions to overcome interoperability challenges.

    The MedMorph Health Care Surveys Content Implementation Guide (IG) specifies how the MedMorph Reference Architecture (RA) IG is leveraged to
    enable health care organizations to implement <a href="usecases.html">Health Care Surveys Use Cases</a> outlined in the IG.

	<h3>Technical Overview</h3>
  <p>
    The main sections of this IG are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="usecases.html">Use Cases</a> - The use cases provide business context for the implementation guide and information that implementers should be
      familiar with before reading the remainder of the IG.  
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="spec.html">Detailed Specification</a> - The formal specification identifying the requirements for the implementers.
    </li>
