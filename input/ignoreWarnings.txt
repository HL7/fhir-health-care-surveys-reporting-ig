# 01: US Core 6.1.0 is the version that is cited in regulation for 2026, the next release of the National Health Care Surveys will move to the next cited release of US Core
WARNING: ImplementationGuide/hl7.fhir.us.health-care-surveys-reporting: ImplementationGuide.dependsOn[1]: The ImplementationGuide uses package hl7.fhir.us.core#6.1.0 released on 2023-06-30, but the most recent appropriate version is 8.0.0. This reference is getting old and the more recent version should be considered

# 02: Inherited from US Core Slicing
INFORMATION: StructureDefinition/hcs-diagnosticreport: StructureDefinition.snapshot.element[12].slicing.discriminator[0]: The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)
INFORMATION: StructureDefinition/hcs-medicationrequest: StructureDefinition.snapshot.element[13].slicing.discriminator[0]: The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)
