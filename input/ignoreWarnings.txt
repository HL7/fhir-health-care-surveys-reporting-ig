# This has been approved by the CPG on 7/13/2023 per the ticket : https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-41578. Motion Brett Marquard/Eric Haas: 13-0-0 
US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on ServiceRequest derive from the core US profile

# 01 US Core 6.1.0 is the version that is cited in regulation for 2026, the next release of the US Public Health Profiles Library will move to the next cited release of US Core
WARNING: The ImplementationGuide uses package hl7.fhir.us.core#6.1.0 released on 2023-06-30, but the most recent appropriate version is 8.0.0. This reference is getting old and the more recent version should be considered

# 02 Inherited from US Core Slicing
